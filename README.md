## **Overall description** 
- This repository contains the codebase and datasets for the M<sup>2</sup>SEGCN project, which is associated with our research paper titled "Multi-Modal Semantics Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network for Session-Based Recommendation". The code provided here is exclusively for the purpose of peer review.
## **Code description** 
### **Implementation details**
We implemented M<sup>2</sup>SEGCN with Pytorch and accelerated the model training using an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4210 CPU @ 2.20GHz CPU and NVIDIA RTX 3090 (24G) GPU. The operating system is Ubuntu 22.04, the system memory is 126G, and the coding platform is Pycharm.
